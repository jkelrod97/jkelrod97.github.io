            <p>Welcome to my personal website! I am a third-year statistics PhD student at <a href=https://www.cmu.edu/dietrich/statistics-datascience/index.html>Carnegie Mellon University</a> (CMU) with a focus on statistical genomics. 
                I grew up in the small college town of Oberlin, Ohio, and did my undergraduate degree in mathematics at Kenyon College in Gambier, Ohio (a tiny village!).
                Following graduation, I completed a postbaccalaureate fellowship at the National Cancer Institute, where I worked with <a href=https://dceg.cancer.gov/about/staff-directory/rosenberg-philip>Dr. Philip Rosenberg</a> on kernel smoothing problems with applications in cancer epidemiology.
                At CMU, I am advised by <a href=https://willtownes.github.io/>Dr. Will Townes</a>, studying statistical methodology for the analysis of single-cell RNA-seq data and multimodal sequencing data. 
                During my first year, I completed a project which explored genetic colocalization methods.
                Currently, I collaborate with the <a href=https://www.pediatrics.pitt.edu/divisions/rheumatology/labs-and-faculty-pages/torok-lab>Torok lab</a> at the University of Pittsburgh, studying RNA expression in pediatric scleroderma patients. 
            </p>

                Forever a product of the liberal arts, I have many interests outside of research. 
                I love to read, alternating between fiction and books on psychology, biomedicine, and other topics that excite me. 
                Over the past few years, I've become obsessed with interior design and even <a href=https://www.youtube.com/@julia_k_elr>make videos</a> documenting the ways in which I've transformed my own spaces.
                I like to run. It gets me outside and keeps my head clear.
                And most importantly, I have two darling cats, <a href=rory_and_theo.html >Rory and Theo</a>. They are the center of my world and make the best company while I'm doing research!
